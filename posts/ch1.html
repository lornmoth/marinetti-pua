<p>A book about the art of seducing women at this moment in time? …. Yes, exactly now, in the futurist blaze of nations, amidst this hygienic, liberating and multiplying war I fell the need to tell you how to seduce women.</p>
<p>This war bestows womankind with its true flavour and its true value. This book would be an anachronism if it were to be published before or after the war.</p>
<p>I am immediately going to prove this to you cheerfully.</p>
<p>The women are immediately going to jump into the trenches to protect themselves from my inevitable barrages. For them this book has nothing to offer other than charges, condemnation and harsh critique on their fair sex. I know this from sustained and vivid experience and through the pen that I am holding, that will glorify this sex, I even feel a kind of erotic spasm. Doing this I am not actually holding a pen but dictating, with a grin on my face, to my close friend Bruno Corra, who is, despite his tender age, a connoisseur of the dangerous subject. I am dictating in this here room marching up and down, my voice is hard and erratic, my steps are sudden and sharp, my numerous cigarettes smoking out spiral memories in the rhythm of my bombarding spores. In this hotel, in which I wait for my marching order to the front, on the train, in the biting smell of grey-green trenches, between the charges and the puffs of soldiers, I am going to continue dictating this book hastily, during which I am using my whole brutality to handle the beautifully flexible body of that women, which is made up of hundreds of women, which every man takes with him into war.  Every man…. especially an Italian, undoubtedly masculine, free of any Nordic presuppositions, enemy of the library and internally rooted in that deep well of sensuality that we call the Mediterranean. An illogical book it is, that is allowed to call itself lucky to be ripped from the undefined hands of ugly women and to be put into the precise and delicate fingers of beautiful women who will, without a doubt, enjoy it.</p>
<p>Beautiful, more or less. I am referring to that mystic-animalistic magnetism, not the perfect beauty, which is stealing any attractiveness from the women. </p>

<p>Wanting to be beautiful is much more than any bodily glamour. On my arduous erotic-sentimental journey I was always looking for an intelligent body, the watchful, who understand that they need to dress up their desires depending on the kind of enjoyment they are seeking. Women who flaunt their “natural beauty” are deeply ridiculous, boring and thoroughly stunted in their pleasure. Bodily intelligence is not learnable nor trainable. It is a kind of voluntary instinct which all predators possess. Precise, longing stares, orchestration of the voice, silky force in their steps, comfortability, with which you want to lay down on a diwan or a pillow on a bed, the continuous correction of their most striking and dangerous flaw. Every woman possesses one of those. I am hearing a twenty-year-old girl with curls and small, round boobs screaming in protest: “I do not possess any flaws!”. Of course, you do, I reply, you want to be perfect. If you don´t want to bore your man, you have to make him forget the absolute anti-sexual and anti-erotic admiration that the symmetry of your proportions evokes in a man. Any twenty-/thirty-/forty-year-old man faced with the perfected beauty of a woman will involuntary feel the boredom one is gripped by involuntarily in a museum. This is a personal conclusion: There are no absolute laws here. Each woman is a beast of her own or to be precise thousands of special and different cases corresponding to the thousands of different sexual entanglements life hold for her. Each woman is dependent on the man she lovers. Nothing is more unchangeable and more unpredictable. A woman in Milan would act shy and half-heartedly as if she was in chains and on withdrawal meanwhile, she will give herself brutally and generous to a man in Rome in nerves, spirit and body. This is by now means a praise of Rome´s erotic qualities but merely a statement about cities in general. This convincing principle however has been disproven by hundreds of contradictory experiences. A Parisian girl from the faubourg of Saint Honoré will, even though she is otherwise not manically inclined, kill herself than rest in an inelegant bed but she also has been banged naturally in fifty stinky beds in more than fifty ultra-stinky hotels in Quartier Latin by me.  I don´t emphasize this this to demonstrate my seductive charm but to show that inside this lady there were two radically different and separated lifestyles and highlight their ability to disperse themselves in different kinds of love completely. Not all men are able to use this disposition to dispersion to their benefit. Indeed, you can differentiate between two different kinds of men: those who can instinctively sense a woman, magnetically influence her, taking her with and understanding and those who only sense her lightly, can only influence her mildly and nearly never understand her. More than half of Italian possess this power to seduce and understand the fair sex. In Spain and France this ability is far less developed. In Russia and England this power is basically non-existent. This power is directly increased by the sun and it´s largest enemies are fog and alcohol. A man who is strives to create an artificial sun on the Nordic sky through alcohol risks creating women with artificial sensitivities. The trust in the loyalty of the woman is the product of an atmosphere without warmth and colour. This trust disappears automatically under the sun of Sicily. In the Oriental world where female infidelity is an undoubtable fatality the eunuch has been invented as a corrective measure. The Nordic woman is free because the man believes in her mental stability and fortitude, furthermore he completely misunderstands her as a typically instinctual, elemental, atmospherical, barometrical being. In an ultra-intellectual Moscow salon, I saw two magnificent women followed by their irrelevant husbands, pale, fragile, twitching eyes, weak handshake, sour voices of scared goats in a bombardment: two decadent poets. I was immediately introduced to the more beautiful of the two half-naked wives, who both didn´t understand a word of French nor Italian. While the lord of the house was translating the distracted chatter of the beautiful women about the literary value of some Russian poet her intelligent body had a lively conversation with mine. An expressive and honest dialogue. The reddish beard, the lorgnon and the limping voice of the husband crumbling in a litany of unnerving which sounded like the howling of a beggar or those of an old pederast who has been left at the gates of a brothel by his friends. This insectoid nibbling seized. Humid atmosphere, the electricity of tropical forests. The sweet weight of both of these female bodies wrapped in these fabrics, in the leafage of the slow fans and the pleasant feathers. Perfumes and jewellery from the Rue de la Paix accentuated the round scents and the spiralling embellishments of their female voices. Using my own voice, I roared out the “Bombardamento di Adrianopoli” with the gestures and gait of a born colonizer. Massive bodily success, a complete fusion with the skin of both of those ladies. I was instructed to sit between these to poet`s wives. They, excited like leaves in the wind. On the basis of my inability to speak the language all the armchairs, images, women, men, velvet, jewellery and silk turned into minerals, plants, animals. In the adjacent salon people were carousing around like the devil. A polyphony of crystals, plugs, voices, foam, blond laughter. The roaring hurricane of a distant piano. Both of the poets, ecstatic about me, sitting across from myself started to have a madrigal contest in my honours which they noted down in the notebooks of their respective ladies. In the meantime, my elbows searched contact with the beauty to my right and the one to my left. Mechanical precision which was immediately recognized and answered. In an effort to complete the Ultra-African ambiance the host turned the electric light on and off in a monotonous interval to simulate a thunderstorm. Every time the light was turned off, I press my lips against the lips of either the one or the other woman while the unkissed one turned away in growing envy. Before me one of the husbands was searching, embarrassingly with a pencil, a cheap rhyme on the lower level of his usual alcohol level. The other one already finished his madrigal. Worried about the delicate harmony of his verses he started reading it to me with a heavy breath and a lorgnon on his nose. A shallow female reader will tell me, somewhat confused, that both of these ladies had to be prostitutes. To this I can only say that between a street prostitute and a decent woman who is sincerely in love with a man a great many nuances exists and in business or in the less businesslike act of cheating a passionate disinterest is present. Those two women were no prostitutes. I got to know one of those women in a very intimate way and discovered her exciting double life: a frenetic-bizarre sensuality, an insatiable greed for the new, passion for the famous man, a willingness to give herself fully to a desiring man on a diwan during a rainy day and at the same time the ability to organize her familial life and to care with diligent regularity about the upbringing of her children. Indeed, she completely changed her personality when she left the house. Maybe she even liked her husband one day years ago. He probably even gave her the kind of mental attention she craved, the one which satisfies her amour-propre in the most beautiful way by reading her verses in bed just like if you offered a marron glacé to a panther. He probably talked about he immortality of the soul during it. Even a luxury broad needs to, from time to time, be considered a German philosopher. My girlfriend insisted on having a misunderstood and rebellious soul. What gain of freedom she expected from this I can´t tell. She was able to, whenever she wants, take the train to spend an afternoon with me in Paris. She cried a whole evening about the memory of a childhood friend from San Remo who died of Typhus. On a vacation to Egypt she took my “Mafarka the Futurist” with her but threw it into the Mediterranean with a celebratory disgust after having the African brutalities of the first chapter translated to her in Russian. She sent me a letter full of insults and contempt on which my translator found, hidden in a corner and nearly invisible, found these words written: “Ja ljublju vas – I love you”. </p>
<p>Mind you, I don´t derive an universal principle from this. It´s is, however, indisputable that the essence of the woman is not just defined by their childlike curiosity, their inability to focus, the fear of monotony, the persistent vanity and the fearful cowardice but most importantly by their ineradicable desire for cheating. Their muscular inferiority made them into half tamed predators who tenderly dreams of constantly cheating on the loved but also hated man – who is after all the constructor of the cage called society. This is the reason that it is essential that that the male seducer needs to cultivate the powers and the tone of an animal tamer. To avoid confusion: I agree with all of this, this is no critique. Women are what they are. That means: the better part of humanity, more flexible, smoother, wittier, more sensible, less programmatic, better at improvisation or the be more concise: The least German part. A seductive, forceful, free, beautiful and brilliant man in comparison to the beautiful, improvised feelings of the woman always seems to have something professional, Teutonic about him. I fully acknowledge the moral qualities of the woman. There are women which, through their ingenuity, their sincerity, charity, willingness to sacrifice themselves, their delicate feeling and their erotic swing manage to baffle, however all their virtues are deeply sexual in nature, they speak to the inner fire which only function is to insure the continuation of the species.</p>
<p>The woman loves variety and war as a great appetizer. The woman, that doesn´t get some male variety fades destroys her magnetic sexual power and thus is complicit in the downfall of the race. On the other site it is also correct that society has, from this primitive base of bravado and war, birthed new impulses, new desires which became stronger and stronger throughout the generations, primarily shame. For male desire, which primarily springs from the natural desire to explore, a woman who undresses flippantly has low seductive power. And this is the reason why she is ready to be captivated by the loved man every time. There are relationships which last for years because the husband and the wife, seemingly instinctive, manage to get variety and arousing war. It´s a question of the will, the vigilant intellect and male power. These are, however, exceptions; we are now on the field of those mysterious relationships which float in the limbo between habit and love.</p>
<p>I am not speaking of cohabitation but of the habit of a mutual desire which constantly searches and discovers. Cohabitation is always destructive because it destroys that desire for danger, for falling, for a fight, for insecurity, which primarily benefits the man, although the woman may also benefit from it. Our ancestors didn´t knew about the incompatibility of love and cohabitation because our unending, minute aesthetic sorrows, which only stem from the common sense of comfort and cleanliness which they never knew. It is definitely hard nowadays to love a woman with whom you have to share both a table and a bed. The process of civilization has made it impossible that a man loves an instinctual, naturally shameless woman who gives herself to many men. On the other hand, it is also impossible for him to love a woman which only undress for him every evening. From this fact stems the desire of the modern woman, with flexible shame, for well measured variety. On Nordic beaches naked and half naked men and women bathe together. I remember having the pleasure to, during a trip in an automobile on the border between Hungary and Transylvania, see the crotch and thighs of hundreds of female farmers on their way to church service, their ornate skirts pulled up to their waist and knotted together above their head to protect the hemline from feces. During a blowout I had the opportunity to see the quaint vanity of a girl which was combing her hair by the window, the breasts bare, naked to the belly. The shame of a woman is seemingly not necessary to kindle the desire of a man. However, the knowledge of her own beauty destroys a woman´s shame everywhere. There are women who undress easily but would however never dare to utter a halfway vulgar word. Others on the other hand become shameless in the face of a modest lover…</p>
<p>Generally speaking, women hate the shameless language of the man if it is not a direct expression of his desire. Vulgar men mostly have bad luck with women. The real man on the other hand, who let´s his desire be known elegantly destroys the trench of shame automatically and finds himself in a perfect position to dare charging forward and deal the final blow. However, she should avoid all the mental talk with which women like to surround themselves to revel in the stalling of the male victory and to watch him drown in the impenetrable verbal morass: “Pure love, eternal fidelity, soul mates, nobody ever understood me! …. I can never make someone happy! …. All men talk like this! ….. How many women have you already told all these words?”.</p>
